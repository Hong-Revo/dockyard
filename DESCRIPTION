Title: Provide tools for interfacing and building docker containers in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ellis Hughes
Maintainer: Ellis Hughes <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: {dockyard} provides the tools to easily create 
    new docker images and start running docker containers from
	within R. Most people say to run and execute your R workflows
	with docker containers, but usually leave the mechanics to doing
	that up to the user. This creates a barrier to entry of knowing
	how to create and work with docker containers. 
	
	{dockyard} aims to narrow the gap by providing opinionated wrappers
	on writing dockerfile's and api's for running, orchestrating,
	and interfacing	with docker containers.
